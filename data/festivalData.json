    "description":"It's snowing in Kabul, and gregarious waiter Mustafa charms a bright, pretty student named Wajma. The pair begins a clandestine relationship--they're playful and passionate but ever mindful of the societal rules they are breaking. When Wajma discovers she is pregnant, her certainty that Mustafa will marry her falters, and as word of their forbidden dalliance gets out, her father must decide between his culturally-held right to uphold family honor and his devotion to his daughter. Wajma (An Afghan Love Story), its title deliberately sardonic, takes an unblinking and unapologetic look at the modern reality of women caught in situations from which there is no escape. \"Akram plays out this contemporary morality tale in a lean, efficient style.... A minor revelation.\"--The Hollywood Reporter. This year's Afghan submission for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. ",

Less a conspiracy thriller than a subtle meditation on complicity, willful ignorance, and the allure of perfection--even at the risk of self-destruction--the film thought-provokingly ponders whether, if you met the \"angel of death\" on the road, would you recognize him? Or might you be charmed by the friendly doctor and his seductive promises to cure your diminutive daughter, fund your creative work, and care for your unborn twins?

While already a chronicler of Cambodia's genocide, he shifts to his own childhood recollections with The Missing Picture. Unable to locate photos from the time, Panh uses hundreds of clay figures and dioramas to convey the action--the rice fields, the camps, the summary executions. Hand-carved and hand-painted, these figures stand in for Panh's parents and family, along with key perpetrators. Scratchy, monochromatic stills from archival propaganda footage are eerily juxtaposed with these colorful, miniature people, all cleverly combining to fashion a moving autobiography. Winner of the Un Certain Regard Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, The Missing Picture artfully explores Panh's preoccupation with how to represent and remember all that's been lost. ",

The bliss of first love is interrupted, however, by Martin's interfering mother, who worries that special needs individuals aren't sufficiently fit for romantic relationships, and by Gabrielle's beloved sister, who is planning a move abroad to live with her fiance.

Like his epic Aftershock (PIFF 35), Xiaogang Feng's sweeping saga is a gut-wrenching account told through the eyes of wealthy landlord Master Fan, forced to flee both famine and advancing troops, and a Time magazine journalist (Adrien Brody) investigating the misery. \"Feng Xiaogang has been called China's Spielberg.

    "description":"Filled with charming, gorgeous animation, The Day of the Crows is a delightful family film. A father raises his son Courge in the wild and warns him never to venture beyond the forest. One day the boy's father is injured, and the son must leave the woods in search of help. Entering a neighboring village, he befriends a young girl and experiences the wonders civilization offers--and the truth about his family's past. Exploring the blurred lines between animal and human, nature and civilization, and the realms of the living and of spirits, underneath is a simple story of a father's lost love and a boy's brave struggle to recapture it.

    "description":"Ernest and Celestine is the winner of France's Cesar Award for Best Animated Feature and numerous other festival prizes. Tucked away in networks of winding subterranean tunnels lives a civilization of hard-working mice, terrified of the bears that live aboveground. Unlike her fellow mice, Celestine is an artist and a dreamer, and when she nearly ends up as breakfast for burly troubadour Ernest, the pair forms an unlikely bond. But it isn't long before their friendship is put on trial by their respective bear-fearing and mice-eating communities. Like a gorgeous watercolor painting brought to life, influences as varied as Buster Keaton, Bugs Bunny, and the outlaw romanticism of Bonnie and Clyde create \"a delightful melding of visual style and narrative pirouettes, a just-about-perfect hand-drawn animated feature.\"--Screen Daily.

On the train, she meets a mysterious, stoic English professor (Gabriel Byrne) and, enamored, decides to try and track him down after they have seemingly parted forever. Shifting in tone from drama to comedy, over the course of a day, Just a Sigh beautifully chronicles the blossoming of an all-too-brief love affair between the two, a romance in Paris that brings hope and passion into Alix's harried life and comfort to her chance lover. \"From Brief Encounter to Before Sunrise, the premise is familiarï¿½. Credit Bonnell for a compelling romance about chance, fate, the different parts we all play, and the journeys we are taking.\"--RTE, Dublin. ",

Age 70 and living in exile in Rome, Murmelstein was the only surviving \"Jewish Elder\" appointed by the Nazis to run the \"model ghetto\" camp at Theresienstadt, Czechoslovakia. Murmelstein's interview wasn't included in the film, but it's the focus of this compelling postscript. Condemned after the war as a collaborator, he explains the terrible accommodation he had to strike with a murderous regime. Lanzmann returns to sites that marked Murmelstein's wartime experiences and uncovers their savage history, but it's the intelligent, witty, courageous Murmelstein who provides the film's most compelling testimony. Comparing himself to Scheherazade from The Arabian Nights, Murmelstein survived, he tells Lanzmann, because he \"had a story to tell.\" ",

Six-year-old Jean is starting first grade. He looks forward to learning to read and write so he won't need Michelle, the girl next door, to read the postcards he gets from his mysteriously absent mother, who writes from around the world about her wild adventures. Even though they seem far-fetched at times, with his father so busy, the postcards bring comfort.

As civil war rages in the rest of the country, the girls are preoccupied with school gossip, learning how to smoke cigarettes, and flirting with the neighborhood boys. Their lives change when Natia receives a pistol as an unexpected love gesture, and suddenly the girls must face circumstances beyond their control. Loosely based on Ekvtimishvili's experiences, In Bloom portrays distinctively fierce female characters who struggle to escape their turbulent families and male-dominated traditions.

Berlin slacker Niko is drifting through his twenties content to let life and responsibilities slide by and oblivious to his growing estrangement. But over the course of a single day, the cosmic balance shifts, imperceptibly at first, and a series of unfortunate and surprising encounters snowball into what could only be described as an existential crisis. His girlfriend turns on him, and when his disappointed father asks him--after discovering that he has long ago dropped out of university--what he has been doing for the last two years, he can only muster, \"I've been thinking.\" If only he could grab a cup of coffee.
