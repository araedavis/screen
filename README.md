Patrons of film festivals frequently have to navigate complex schedules with a large number of events and venues, while also having to prioritize the films that most interest them, preferred genres, and countries of origin. Attendees have to juggle these different factors to create an itinerary that works with their own availability for a multi-day event, and also quickly locate the very films that interest them.

Using the Portland International Film Festival as a case study, we propose to create a user interface in which attendees can filter a festival schedule by genre, country of origin, venue, and date. The interface will be mobile-friendly, easy to navigate, and will allow a user to customize, return to, and print their own schedule for a multi-day festival.  Users will also be able to access YouTube trailers and easily post their own reviews to social media.
 

**User Stories**

As a heavy user, I can filter a festival’s entire schedule by multiple categories - genre, location, country of origin, and date because I have specific interests and want to slim down the quantity of information right away. 

As a user I can create a custom schedule of films I want to see, and access this schedule via the browser, on mobile (on or offline), or a print-friendly version because film festivals are complicated and advanced planning is necessary.  

As a mobile user, I want to be able to favorite films and easily tweet about them because I want to share them with friends and engage with other festival goers that saw the same film.

As a casual user, I want to be able to view trailers for each film in the festival schedule because I don’t have time to read long descriptions and want to be amused by moving pictures while I am waiting for the bus.

As a casual user, I want to be able to access a ‘get lucky’ feature that shows me one random title section so that I don’t experience information overload because there are so many different films on offer. 

As a user, I want to be able to view the films at venues in a certain area because I only attend events in my neighborhood.

As an employee at a film center or other arts organization, I want this interface to be clear and easy to navigate, to increase attendance at the event. 

As an employee at a film center or other arts organization, I want users to have Twitter integration with hashtags for my organization and the film title, to promote audience engagement and interest in my events. 

As a developer, I want app documentation to be clear and straightforward, so that the interface can be reused by other film festivals and arts organizations. 

**Future Expansions**
Client organization (NW Film Center or other arts organization) will be able to access data on user favorite-ing behavior in order to help guide future festival programming.
