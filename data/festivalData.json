The pair begins a clandestine relationship--they're playful and passionate but ever mindful of the societal rules they are breaking. When Wajma discovers she is pregnant, her certainty that Mustafa will marry her falters, and as word of their forbidden dalliance gets out, her father must decide between his culturally-held right to uphold family honor and his devotion to his daughter. Wajma (An Afghan Love Story), its title deliberately sardonic, takes an unblinking and unapologetic look at the modern reality of women caught in situations from which there is no escape. \"Akram plays out this contemporary morality tale in a lean, efficient style.... A minor revelation.\"--The Hollywood Reporter. This year's Afghan submission for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. ",

Less a conspiracy thriller than a subtle meditation on complicity, willful ignorance, and the allure of perfection--even at the risk of self-destruction--the film thought-provokingly ponders whether, if you met the \"angel of death\" on the road, would you recognize him? Or might you be charmed by the friendly doctor and his seductive promises to cure your diminutive daughter, fund your creative work, and care for your unborn twins?

While already a chronicler of Cambodia's genocide, he shifts to his own childhood recollections with The Missing Picture. Unable to locate photos from the time, Panh uses hundreds of clay figures and dioramas to convey the action--the rice fields, the camps, the summary executions. Hand-carved and hand-painted, these figures stand in for Panh's parents and family, along with key perpetrators. Scratchy, monochromatic stills from archival propaganda footage are eerily juxtaposed with these colorful, miniature people, all cleverly combining to fashion a moving autobiography. Winner of the Un Certain Regard Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, The Missing Picture artfully explores Panh's preoccupation with how to represent and remember all that's been lost. ",

Like his epic Aftershock (PIFF 35), Xiaogang Feng's sweeping saga is a gut-wrenching account told through the eyes of wealthy landlord Master Fan, forced to flee both famine and advancing troops, and a Time magazine journalist (Adrien Brody) investigating the misery. \"Feng Xiaogang has been called China's Spielberg.

Tucked away in networks of winding subterranean tunnels lives a civilization of hard-working mice, terrified of the bears that live aboveground. Unlike her fellow mice, Celestine is an artist and a dreamer, and when she nearly ends up as breakfast for burly troubadour Ernest, the pair forms an unlikely bond. But it isn't long before their friendship is put on trial by their respective bear-fearing and mice-eating communities. Like a gorgeous watercolor painting brought to life, influences as varied as Buster Keaton, Bugs Bunny, and the outlaw romanticism of Bonnie and Clyde create \"a delightful melding of visual style and narrative pirouettes, a just-about-perfect hand-drawn animated feature.\"--Screen Daily.

Shifting in tone from drama to comedy, over the course of a day, Just a Sigh beautifully chronicles the blossoming of an all-too-brief love affair between the two, a romance in Paris that brings hope and passion into Alix's harried life and comfort to her chance lover. \"From Brief Encounter to Before Sunrise, the premise is familiarï¿½.

Age 70 and living in exile in Rome, Murmelstein was the only surviving \"Jewish Elder\" appointed by the Nazis to run the \"model ghetto\" camp at Theresienstadt, Czechoslovakia. Murmelstein's interview wasn't included in the film, but it's the focus of this compelling postscript. Condemned after the war as a collaborator, he explains the terrible accommodation he had to strike with a murderous regime. Lanzmann returns to sites that marked Murmelstein's wartime experiences and uncovers their savage history, but it's the intelligent, witty, courageous Murmelstein who provides the film's most compelling testimony. Comparing himself to Scheherazade from The Arabian Nights, Murmelstein survived, he tells Lanzmann, because he \"had a story to tell.\" ",

An unforgettable experience, Lygizos's debut feature marks him as one of the most impressive new talents to emerge since the international breakthrough of the Greek New Wave.\"--Toronto International Film Festival.

    "description":"In 1985, in the midst of China's economic reform period, three college students in Beijing--an overzealous country boy who refuses to accept his destiny of being a farmer, a cynical intellectual with a superiority complex, and a romantic idealist who wants to be a movie star--bond through a shared fascination with Western literature, music, and movies and an ambition to live the American dream. This sets the three on a roundabout course toward the foundation of a wildly successful English-language tutorial institute--but fame, enormous fortune, and lawsuits test the bonds of ambition. Shot by superstar cinematographer Christopher Doyle and dubbed \"the Chinese Social Network,\" this seductive, epic tale of business bravado reveals both the spirit and the detail of China's dramatic economic coming-of-age.

Fai is struggling to find a way to bring his pregnant (in violation of the one-child policy) wife Tai over the Hong Kong border from Shenzhen to give birth to their second child, even though he crosses the border easily every day working as Anna's chauffeur. Anna, in contrast, is struggling to keep up the facade of the ostentatious lifestyle into which she has married, after the sudden disappearance of her husband amid financial turmoil.

    "description":"From The Producers to Bullets Over Broadway, the challenges of putting on a stage show have proved a rich source of inspiration for comedy films. In this comedic ensemble piece, a Mexican theater company is in rehearsals for a production of Caligula by Albert Camus. Things aren't going well: the lead actress is furious with the neurotic and depressed director, the lead actor is having panic attacks, and an older actor can't memorize his lines. The assistant director--a failed actress--turns out to have a drug problem. Then the tech crew gets attacked by a group of \"emo\" teenagers. It's going to take a miracle for this play to open.... This delightful backstage comedy won the Audience Award, Critics' Award, and Best Actress Award at the Guadalajara Film Festival. ",

Schizophrenic in the best ways possible, this madcap-experimental-comedy-fever-dream is alternately hilarious, poetic, and beautiful. Inspired by Dennis Hopper's infamous The Last Movie (1971), as well as the documentary shot during its editing on Hopper's ranch, The American Dreamer, the film is a loving tribute to a great American artist--and to that sacred material known as celluloid--and yet it bravely looks ahead to new possibilities in the ever-changing landscape of the seventh art. This may be the last movie, but it's the first of its kind.\"--Vancouver International Film Festival. ",

Fed up with that life, Hamid throws a rock at a police car and earns himself two years in prison. When he returns, an eerie calm masks his newfound zealotry, and his fundamentalist friends seem to exercise a powerful influence. Inspired by the real-life 2003 terrorist attacks in Casablanca, Ayouch's film is a thoughtful and affecting inquiry into how ordinary people come to do desperate, unfathomable things.

This newest work from Harvard's Sensory Ethnography Lab--which previously produced Sweetgrass (PIFF 32) and Leviathan (PIFF 36)--is thrillingly mysterious in its effects: a staged documentary, a cross between science fiction and ethnography, an airborne version of an Andy Warhol screen test.

The relationship with his father is a difficult one, and Helmer lives in a state of solitude and frustration. The arrival of an attractive farmhand triggers complex feelings of desire and hesitation in Helmer and creates a new momentum in his life.

    "description":"Winner of the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival, this dark tragicomic expose chronicles the efforts of an overly protective and domineering mother, Cornelia, who uses all of the means at her disposal to keep her reckless adult son, Barbu, out of jail when he is accused of killing a child in a drunken hit-and-run. Cornelia is an educated, wealthy woman, an architect by trade, who views her privilege in Romanian society as a right that extends to her son; she has no qualms about offering bribes or coercing the police and witnesses to lie. But the impassive Barbu, increasingly resentful of his mother's domination and bullying, comes to realize that he has a say in his fate too. This year's Romanian submission for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar. ",

Living with his ailing grandfather, he falls in with the wrong crowd and, after committing larceny, ends up in juvenile detention. There, he reunites with Hyo-seung, his destitute mother, who gave birth to him as a teenager and left him when he was only three years old. Against the backdrop of Seoul's affluent metropolis, Ji and his mother's story is as much about social problems as it is about a young outsider's challenge to rise above history repeating itself.

Tired of her relationship with her teacher, the fickle--and married--filmmaker Seongjun? Will the events of the coming weeks rouse her from her listlessness, or will she carry on dreaming? With its focus on fraught male-female relationships, mix of gentle comedy and meditative melancholia, and playful way with narrative repetition and fragmentation, this is clearly a Hong Sang-soo film. In Hong's view of human foibles, the various men hitting on Haewon are again prone to bathos and self-delusion, while she herself is as insecure and indecisive as an Eric Rohmer protagonist. Like those patience-trying heroines, she's rightly regarded with bemusement and compassion--wherein lie the film's wit and charm. ",

Working with the tiniest of micro-budgets, Cavestany stages a series of bizarre, Buï¿½uelian scenarios that offer a cracked view of contemporary Spain in the wake of the economic crisis. Making use of some of Spain's greatest actors alongside faces, he places them in bizarre situations that will have you laughing out loud. Moving from one nondescript location to the next, a theme, or perhaps more of an undercurrent, emerges--until the fiercely political nature of the film becomes apparent. Voyeuristic and confounding, Cavestany uses the preposterous to highlight the all-too-real, capturing people in places doing very, very peculiar things.\"--Toronto International Film Festival. ",

The film was called Emak Bakia, a title rumored to be obtained from a gravestone in a Biarritz cemetery--or perhaps it was the name of the house in which the artist stayed. But what did it really mean? Alegria, inspired by the whimsically inventive Ray, determines to uncover the truth behind the layers of myth. His journey is not, however, a straightforward one. At one point he decides to follow the path of a hare. He finds references to the film in singular nooks and crannies across Europe, from clowns to publishers, from a vintage clothes shop to old postcards. An absurdist voyage or an assemblage of coincidence, Alegria's film brilliantly channels this legendary, boundary-breaking artist. ",

Wander Madrid, get drunk, go on dates, meet up with friends, fall in love, and of course talk about movies. Shot on black-and-white 16mm film stock, writer/director Trueba's film is a joyous love letter to cinema and the filmmaking process, in particular the French New Wave, whose vintage aesthetic the film consciously evokes. While a film about the craft of making work, it's also a meditation on contemporary Spanish society, a boy-meets-girl tale, and a seductive homage to Madrid, with the city as much a protagonist of the movie as Carril's Leï¿½n.
